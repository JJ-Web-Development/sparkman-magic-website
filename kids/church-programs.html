          Part time entertainers may be inexpensive, but since they only perform
          a few times per year, they are usually not a good value. It takes
          literally hundreds of shows for an entertainer to learn to hold the
          attention of children. An entertainer who is equally adept at
          entertaining adults, is a rare find indeed.<br /><br />
          A big part of entertaining children is keeping them laughing. And why
          wouldn’t you want a Born Again Christian in front of your kids
          involving the Gospel in the entertainment? Could you feel comfortable
          with a secular entertainer?

          <strong>So, You have a problem.</strong> Finding a good children’s
          entertainer is hard work.<br /><br />
          You have to find an entertainer for a kids at your church. You need an
          act that is clean, age appropriate, fun, entertaining, memorable,
          hold’s the attention of today’s kids, and hopefully, can verbalize the
          gospel.<br /><br />
          I am Doug Sparkman and my Comedy Magic shows may just be perfect for
          you. I would like to provide one of my comedy magic shows for your
          next children’s event, whether it is Children’s Church, an Upwards
          Basketball Banquet, or any Special Event. My first goal is for the
          kids to have fun. If they are not laughing, stretching their arms to
          the ceiling in an effort to help, and leaning forward in the seat to
          get closer, I am not earning my keep as an entertainer. They will have
          a great time, but they will also remember having a great time at
          Church.

          Doesn’t “MAGIC” send a mixed message?

        <p class="magic-bible-text">
          When you see my show, you will not imagine that any child thinks I
          have “magic powers.” In fact they typically speak about how funny the
          show was. If you are still concerned, I can make sure to give the kids
          my short talk about the difference between Magic and a Miracle. I
          realize the Bible references staying away from false prophets and
          magicians. There is a major difference in the false prophets of the
          old testament and magic as ENTERTAINMENT.

        <p class="magic-bible-text">
          I will give you a simple example. I bring out a rope and discuss how
          in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve had direct communication with God.
          When they ate the Fruit the line was cut (I cut the rope). But,
          through faith in Jesus’ Death and Resurrection, and our Repentance and
          Acceptance of his Forgiveness, we again have a connection to God. The
          I restore the rope. Each program contains from 1-3 Gospel routines,
          depending on the program. The kids favorite is when I get a kid on a
          table, pull out an electric jigsaw, and tell them about Abraham going
          to sacrifice Isaac. Yes, it’s a side splitter.
