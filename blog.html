                One of my professional Clown friends told me, "No-one has
                invented anything new since the Phoenicians." Zig Ziglar would
                say, "That is profound." Sparkman says, "Especially for a
                clown."

                The Ancient Egyptians developed Astronomy which led them to the
                calendar. They also developed Math, Geometry, Medicine and
                Science. They discovered how to use the Papyrus plant to make a
                form of paper, and they invented pens and ink. They also
                invented writing and literature via heiroglyphics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Phoenicians then invented the Alphabet, cornered the market
                on the manufacture of papyrus, perfected ship building,
                navigation around the Mediterranean, developed trade routes, and
                invented mass production. It is hard to invent something totally
                new after the developments of these two cultures.

                My recent comments about Simon Cowell are for our own
                self-improvement as well as others. There is a reason why a
                school hires a coach that yells and is tough on the kids!
                because he can get more out of them than they knew they had in
                them. When the kids know he is all about them, they love him for
                it.

                I wrote about helping others, but the best way that we can
                improve in any area, is to get an expert to draw the best out of
                us. The process may be tough, but the reward will be great.

                Last time, I mentioned the value of having a Simon Cowell. We
                occasionally see a friend who needs our help in a touchy
                situation. Instead of dealing with the uncomfortable
                conversation, it would be nice to have Simon do it. He probably
                needs to tell us about our blind spots too.
              </p>
              <p>
                When watching a person with no musical ability audition for
                American Idol, we would think "Didn't she have a friend that
                could tell her she couldn't carry a tune in a bucket?" I am sure
                she did, but the friend did not want to have an uncomfortable
                conversation, that could unwind their friendship.
              </p>
              <p>
                How can we be a kinder Simon Cowell and deliver needed
                information, that may not be well received? We could be
                addressing many blind spots like, a quick temper or constantly
                talking about others. I will address this issue from the example
                of the singer and you can adjust it according to your needs. -
                By the way, in most cases, this not for the work place, it is
                for a close friend or family member.

                How can we give painful advice, that the receiver may not want
                to hear?
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Thoughtfully decide if the advice is really important in the
                  outcome of the persons life, or if it doesn't matter that
                  much.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The person receiving the advice must respect our knowledge and
                  love for them, otherwise discuss the issue with someone that
                  does receive this respect and pass the difficult conversation
                  to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We must plan our words in advance and stick to them as much as
                  possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We preface the talk by saying something along these lines.
                  "You know I love you and want what is best for you. Something
                  has been nagging at me lately and I have ignored it, because I
                  am afraid it will cause tension between us. But, the more I
                  ignore it, the more I am afraid it may hurt you in the long
                  run, if I don't mention it."
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then get into the problem! We must tell them something like "I
                  know singing is your passion, but I don't think you are ever
                  going to be successful without proper training, and practice."
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the painful issue is brought to light, discuss
                  solutions.
                  <br /><br />
                  A. I have checked into it and we can get you specialized
                  training!
                  <br /><br />
                  B. Set goals and a timeline related to the solutions.
                  <br /><br />
                  C. If the person will never succeed in this area, there should
                  be a date to drop it and find another "passion" (for which the
                  person is better suited) to take the place of the problem.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                I hope you accomplish closer relationships through rare,
                uncomfortable conversations.

                Everyone knows Simon Cowell. He is the harsh judge from the
                first 10 seasons of American Idol.
              </p>
              <p>
                I attended a conference on show business in Hollywood quite a
                few years ago. Participants in this exclusive experience were
                critiqued, often harshly, for their entertainment skills and
                business practices. While the directors of the program could
                have been kinder, their constructive criticism was right on the
                money. From their perspective, the shockingly harsh delivery of
                the criticism would wake up the participants and help them
                improve their techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the way things work in Hollywood, criticisms are often
                delivered in a cruel way, but the agent
                (producer/director/acting coach - take your pick) is usually
                right, and the person being dressed down often grows from the
                experience.

                I know a guy that cannot carry on a comfortable conversation. He
                is a nice and friendly guy, but he is, well, awkward. Yet, he is
                spending all of his time, money, and effort to become an
                entertainer. He needs Simon Cowell to tell him, you cannot be an
                entertainer before you learn to talk to people.
              </p>
              <p>
                No matter what you think about Simon Cowell, he knows what he is
                talking about. He has discovered and tutored many singers and
                actors. Listening to his insight, however harsh, can change the
                world for an entertainer. Simon told Carrie Underwood she would
                be the most successful entertainer that had ever been on
                "American Idol." He knows his stuff.

                We currently live in a world of Political Correctness. Instead
                of giving valuable, Simon Cowell advice, we keep our mouths shut
                for fear of hurting feelings. This means that people who need
                help won't get it. I don't know all of the answers, but I will
                try to tackle them anyway - next time.

                Having only two options, I have used Comcast or AT&T for
                internet service for at least 15 years. As most people I have
                spoken with, I have never been thrilled with either company,
                just like I wouldn't be thrilled with the electric company if my
                electricity was off regularly.
              </p>
              <p>
                It has been interesting recently to see both companies scramble.
                AT&T has suddenly been adding their faster U-verse product as
                fast as possible in the Nashville suburbs. Comcast has also
                ramped up their speed to a level far beyond what any homeowner
                can use. This sounds great, except the internet is still down at
                least once a day. In my testing, when the internet is down, 100
                megabits per second is the same as ZERO megabits per second.
              </p>
              <p>
                The interesting thing is the reason for all of this recent
                hustle - Google Fiber has come to Nashville and they are
                expanding quickly. Comcast has been running commercials in the
                area about how they are faster and better than Google. Their
                latest commercials are saying they had an epiphany and their new
                focus is customer service. They even smile when they say it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The whole ordeal reminds me of the two guys who are running from
                a Bear and one of them says he doesn't have to outrun the bear,
                he only has to outrun the other guy. Google Fiber only has to be
                better than AT&T and Comcast to get everyone's business, hardly
                outrunning a bear.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Real Lesson? If the two companies had a great product and
                good customer service for the last 15 years, they would have
                nothing to worry about. This should be a reminder to all of us,
                to make sure we do our best for our customers, before the Google
                of our industry comes to town.

                For my money the best sales and motivational speaker was Zig
                Ziglar. My mother owned almost every book and tape series that
                he released. When I was young I went with her to see him speak
                several times and we were in the audience when he recorded one
                of his audio tape sets (now they are on CDs of course -
                httpss://www.ziglar.com/online-store-new/). I also got to meet
                him briefly after that program.

                I did not really get to spend time with him until my buddy from
                the last newsletter, Cadillac Jack, introduced me. Zig and Jack
                were friends - top salesman have a lot to talk about. When Zig
                had a seminar in Little Rock, Jack asked me to attend.
              </p>
              <p>
                I squeezed it in and drove into town the morning of the seminar
                and walked in just late. Instead of sitting in the back row,
                Jack walked me up to the VIP section. The program was fantastic!
                When it was time for lunch, Jack had me in the room with Zig, he
                introduced us and we spent time together.

              <p>
                I am still thankful that Jack made sure I got to know one of my
                heroes and I cannot think of one of them without thinking about
                the other.

                In my experience, reaching out to new people always has its
                rewards. It will expand your comfort zone. It will help you make
                new friends like Cadillac Jack. You never know where those
                friends can take you, maybe through the velvet ropes to the
                World's Greatest Sales Trainer.

                Creative Corner Businesses must have income to pay their

                advertisers; well you get the point. We are not all salespeople,
                but unless you work for the government, you are paid from sales.

                So we should all be salespeople. We don't have to sell anything,
                just being good at our job, and making customers happy is a form
                of selling.

                I was entertaining at a Trade Show in Little Rock years ago and
                I met the famous Cadillac Jack. Jack was the top Cadillac
                salesman in the state and it seemed like everyone knew him. I
                was fortunate enough to hear him speak and he loved magic, so we
                instantly hit it off.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jack is now retired, but he had a great checklist that he used
                to "qualify" a new customer. This made his time seem valuable
                and the potential customer was taken aback as they were being
                "qualified." He always got a smile when his final qualifying
                question was, "What is your favorite dessert?"
              </p>
              <p>
                Jack went out of his way to make the sale, he would deliver your
                new car anywhere in the state, service it when you were out of
                town, and guess what he delivered on your birthday - your
                favorite dessert. Eventually Jack did not have to qualify many
                new customers, his time was filled selling new Cadillacs to his
                regular customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jack knew that it was much easier keep a customer than to get a
                new one. He also knew that a happy customer was likely to spread
                the word. I am sure if you had the chance to talk to Jack, he
                would challenge you - regardless of your job - to make your
                customers happy they met you.

                The compelling presentations that I have discussed in recent
                newsletters all have one thing in common - an emotional hook.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my Corporate Creativity Speech, I discuss our general
                tendency to think that other people are like us. They have the
                same likes and dislikes, vote the same way, have similar
                hobbies, feelings, wants, needs!
              </p>
              <p>
                In reality, many (if not most) people are different than we are,
                in most of those areas. Typically, the friends we choose have
                the most in common with us, which is probably why we tend to
                think "Everyone" feels like we do.
              </p>
              <p>
                While this is a good thing to be aware of, it is absolutely
                essential if we want to reach a person.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether we are marketing a product, raising a child, writing a
                song, starting an intervention, or helping a friend, we need to
                know the feelings of the person or group we are trying to reach.
                You don't have to listen to too many country songs to learn that
                even tough guys have emotions and that is what reaching people
                is all about an emotional hook.
              </p>
              <p>
                All good movies, song lyrics, books, even clowns and magicians,
                reach the emotions of their audience. Creators reach a large
                audience by writing from the heart. We can reach an individual
                audience by putting ourselves in their moccasins.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether we are selling widgets or life changing advice, we need
                to bring wisdom and logic to the conversation. We make the sale
                appealing with an emotional hook.

                The final Compelling Presentation - until I think of another
                one. Steve Jobs was fired from Apple in 1985. That is the way
                Steve tells it, and the way it has always been reported. The
                person who fired him, John Sculley, says that they had a
                disagreement about how to save the company in a period of
                declining sales. Sculley said Steve was asked to leave the
                Macintosh division but he was never fired, he resigned. Since
                this statement was made via twitter in 2015, I am not sure I buy
                the Sculley side of the story. However the removal of Steve from
                Apple was an ironic twist since Steve Jobs was the one who hired
                Sculley as CEO.
              </p>
              <p>
                John Sculley was the President of Pepsi Cola and is credited
                with the "Pepsi Challenge." Pepsi conducted blind taste tests in
                which people tasted Pepsi and Coke and picked their favorites.
                Of course, on the commercials Pepsi always won. This was a
                genius marketing gimmick that significantly helped Pepsi gain
                market share in the early eighties.
              </p>
              <p>
                Steve Jobs wanted Sculley to bring his creative marketing genius
                to Apple Computer. He brought Sculley to Cupertino, gave him the
                multi-million dollar tour and practically begged him to be
                Apple's CEO. Sculley was declining the position until Steve
                said, "Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your
                life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?" That
                one sentence, compelled Sculley to leave Pepsi and come to
                Apple.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, Steve eventually returned to Apple and in many
                ways, changed the world.

                I want to give another example of a Compelling Presentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is widely reported that the Southeastern Conference is the
                toughest football conference. This fact is well supported
                because 9 of the last 10 National Championships were won by a
                SEC team.
              </p>
              <p>
                James Franklin was the coach of Vanderbilt for 3 years before
                becoming the head coach at Penn State in 2014. He brought
                Vanderbilt success that they had never seen before in football.
              </p>
              <p>
                In case you are not a football fan, Vanderbilt is considered one
                of the top universities in America from an educational
                perspective, but football was not one of its strengths. This
                would not be so bad if they played Harvard and Yale, but they
                are in the SEC and have to take on LSU and Alabama. They were
                additionally hindered because Vanderbilt requires athletes to
                have higher ACT scores than other schools.
              </p>

                Although the NCAA has strict limitations on all of college
                sports, there is at least one annual recruiting event that can
                have entertainment. I was hired to entertain football prospects
                at one of these events and I met Coach Franklin and heard him
                speak.
              </p>
              <p>
                He was speaking to prospects that had not signed with a school.
                However, they were all leaning toward playing for other
                universities, most with mediocre football teams. During his
                talk, Coach Franklin encouraged them to attend Vanderbilt,
                because they would get a World Class education that they can use
                when football is over for them, and they can play in the SEC.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coach Franklin had two things those kids wanted, a great
                education and a chance to play the best that football had to
                offer. Franklin's pitch was a big reason he was able to recruit
                better talent at Vanderbilt and build a program that could
                compete in the SEC.

                Steve Jobs may have been the King of Compelling. There are
                several great books about him. Steve probably had more warts
                than he had genius, but he did change your world - even if you
                never owned an Apple product.
              </p>

                Bill Atkinson was in Seattle working on his PhD in Biology in
                1978 when Apple only had 30 employees. He was courted to be a
                programmer because Bill used computers for his work in biology.
                He enjoyed his tour of the campus but was headed home to work on
                his PhD when Jobs mentioned how fun it was to surf on the front
                of the wave, as opposed to dog paddling on the back of the wave.
              </p>
              <p>
                He hooked Bill when he told him, "You read about the latest
                computer technology coming out of Seattle two years after it is
                developed. If you work here, you will be riding the wave and you
                will help change the future (paraph),"
              </p>
              <p>
                Bill immediately began working for Apple, he never got his PhD,
                and he wrote software that made the first Macintosh work. He
                changed the future. If we can give our audiences a compelling
                Steve Jobs hook, maybe they will change their own future.

                Over the years I have spoken at many corporate events. They
                usually have a central focus like team-building, training,
                improving sales, etc. The organizers give me information that
                they want delivered, and I make that information into a

                I had not been doing this long, when I was hired to speak on a

                were some industry heavies and a famous person on the bill, and

                FedEx. She had great information, but she was as dry as day old
                toast. As I listened to her my nervousness disappeared because,
                from a presentational perspective, she was easy to follow. I did

                Last time I mentioned my stagnant racquetball game. While there
                are many areas of my game that I am trying to improve, I
                discussed a 3 step procedure designed to improve my approach to
                serving. I put this procedure in place because my great serving
                game, had become inconsistent.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also mentioned the visualization taught by my friend Andy
                Roberts, former world's number one professional racquetball
                player. He expressed the importance of a great serve. He said,
                "The serve is the only time that you get to drop the ball and
                hit it." Of course this gives you much more potential of hitting
                a good shot than chasing down a 150 mph ball hit by your
                opponent.
              </p>

                conversation we should make the most of it. We should prepare
                what we are going to say and even rehearse it. We should
                anticipate responses and be ready to address them. This

                them to your advantage.

                I love systems, formulas, or procedures. I am not a chef, but I
                can follow a recipe. Wouldn't it be great if everything we
                wanted to accomplish had a foolproof, multi-step process. For
                example - Make a million dollars by following these 10 steps.

                Unfortunately, I don't know the foolproof 10 steps to a million,
                but I can illustrate a way that you can apply your own steps to
                solve your problems.

                I play competitive racquetball. I have had frustration recently
                as I have been losing to people I used to beat. They are winning
                because they have improved their problem areas which I used to
                exploit. I am losing because I have remained stagnant. So, I
                have gotten coaching. While my coach is helping me improve my
                problem areas, I am remembering former training that I have
                slowly forgotten over the years.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I was coached by a former number one ranked pro he told me
                to visualize the serve I want to make, before I go into my
                service motion. I often approach the service box with other
                things on my mind like, "I have to make great serves to catch
                up," or "Only 2 more points to win." These mental thoughts do
                not improve my play, so I have recently given myself a 3 step
                serving procedure.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Visualize the serve going exactly where I want to put it.
                </li>
                <li>Watch the ball as I make my swing.</li>
                <li>Run out of the service box prepared for the next shot.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Why not make a short procedure for your "issues." For example,
                if you are afraid of public speaking...
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Take a deep breath.</li>
                <li>Visualize the audience in their underwear.</li>
                <li>Try not to laugh.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Well that may not be your exact procedure, but the point is make
                your own procedure for your weak spots. Training (coaching)
                doesn't hurt either.

                Last Time I mentioned one of the picnics where I entertained for
                Preston Medlock last year. He has finally completed changing his
                company name from Presto Partyz to PicnicMaster.

              <p>
                I mention him again because he has developed a creative company
                that stays ahead of the curve to make company picnics and other
                large events a memorable experience. I love his story.
              </p>
              <p>
                Preston was a very successful salesman and when I first met him
                he sold pipe and plumbing supplies. Way back in 1993 his oldest
                child was having his 4th birthday and Preston's wife asked him
                to dance in a purple dinosaur costume for the party. His
                dinosaur was such a hit and guests wanted to hire him for their
                parties on the spot. He eventually had dozens of costumes and
                entertaining routines to go with them. Birthday Parties led to
                corporate events and eventually he began buying climbing walls
                and other equipment. Today he can produce complete picnics for
                thousands of people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Preston did the most important thing we can do with a big idea,
                he gave it a try. He dropped things that did not work and
                expanded areas that did work until he eventually quit selling
                pipe and became The Picnic Master.

                Preston Medlock hired me for my first large gig when magic was
                still my hobby. It was a grand opening of a large, swanky mall
                in a Memphis Suburb. About 20 variety entertainers were there
                for a week. If you need a guy who can play a tuba while riding a

                Preston also had a real job a the time. He now owns "Picnic
                Master" and his main business is large company picnics. He still
                hires me occasionally and last October I was entertaining at a
                huge picnic in the plains of Missouri. The company annually
                invites the whole town to the picnic, but it was unseasonably
                cold and windy last year. Preston covered the dining area with a
                tent top large enough for Ringling Bros. They must have had some
                form of heaters because it was warm under the big top. (Yes, I
                went to Engineering school but at the time I was focused on
                robbing people of their reality.)

                I am fluent in Hand Motion Spanglish. I can perform some card

                version of Spanish and my skills at Charades. I ran into an
                older Hispanic couple who could not speak English. They were
                obviously freezing and I asked, "Tienes Frio?" in my best Speedy
                Gonzales accent. They were cold, so I proceeded to point them to
                the tent top and tell them it was calor in there. It turns out
                that El Tent Topo does not mean anything in Spanish, but
                pointing your finger works with everybody.

                Fine carpentry requires skill, attention to detail, diligence,
                dedication, and perseverance. When the carpenter's creation
                looks complete, he may still have hours of sanding and staining
                left to do. What really impresses me is a carpenter who can make
                his own plans for a project. This is where the creativity takes
                place. He takes all of his knowledge of materials, structure,
                mathematics, and construction to design a custom product.

                for which we feel unqualified.

                I started playing piano at age 6 and got into college on band
                scholarship with my trumpet. However, I will never forget when I
                watched a class of 4 year olds learning to hear an A (the tuning
                note for the violin). The teacher would sing an A and the kids
                would grab it from the air and put it in their ear. Then they
                would sing the A. At the end of the class, the teacher would
                sing an A, and the kids were told to put it in their ear and not
                release it until they were in the hall. The kids that continued
                playing violin for a few years can give you an A at any time.

                Throughout my years of music I was amazed at my friends who had
                "perfect" or "relative" pitch. Years later I learned it was
                something they developed. I certainly would have been a better
                musician if I had known it in those days. You don't have to be a
                child to learn to play an instrument or improve your pitch. I
                have seen many older kids and adults take up the violin and they
                learn much quicker than little ones because they have a greater
                aptitude and longer attention span.

                My Mother was the catalyst that got our daughters involved in
                Suzuki Violin training. I am the parent of two accomplished
                musicians which are A student's at difficult schools. They are
                also well adjusted Christian kids. A great deal of time and
                effort goes into raising well balanced kids, and I am still not
                sure that my wife and I know what we are doing. I do know that
                the daily discipline of practicing music perfectly was
                challenging work for us and the kids. When I saw how easy school
                was for them compared to other students, I knew it was worth it.

                During the Suzuki heavy years, I observed kids with all levels
                of music ability, learn to play instruments well. I often had
                the pleasure of watching over 100 kids playing music for hours
                with no signs of ADHD or bad behavior. My kids were not born
                with natural music talent, and they don't have particularly high
                IQ's. So, I asked one of the greatest Suzuki teachers in the
                country if all of his students did well in school. He told me
                they do well at everything. Their daily practice and music
                memorization set the stage for their whole life.

                In my last letter I told you that the great Dr. Suzuki spent his
                life teaching children to play music. However, he had no problem
                with the fact that most did not pursue music as adults. Dr.
                Suzuki said he was not out to create professional musicians. He
                wanted to create good citizens. He has helped create thousands
                of professional musicians and hundreds of thousands of good
                citizens.
              </p>
              <p>
                One way these students became great citizens is due to the
                statistics that show music students excel at math and science.
                Additionally Suzuki students memorize all of their music. When
                you have learned to store a Bach concerto in your head,
                memorizing for school is, well, child's play. So music students
                become good school students that get good jobs and so on. More

                Many people say the greatest pedagogue of the 20th century was
                Shinichi Suzuki. He was the guy who developed the Suzuki Violin
                training method. Like all great creative solutions, his program
                began with a simple idea... Suzuki thought that Japanese is a
                difficult language, but all Japanese children learn to speak it.
                Why can't all children learn to play a musical instrument. More
                on Dr. Suzuki in the next blog.
