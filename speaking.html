        Sparkman is not just an entertainer. He often uses magic to illustrate a
        business message. This is a tool to keep the audience alert, and the
        message memorable. Each important point is illustrated with humor,
        magic, or audience participation, and sometimes, all three.<br /><br />
        Sparkman has delivered business information in this manner at Team
        Building Events, Sales Meetings, Trade Shows, Conferences, Chamber of
        Commerce Events and more. <br /><br />
        These custom programs can range from a fun break in a day of industry
        speakers, to technical information sprinkled with entertainment. Call
        with ideas and we will develop the perfect program for your event.

            Introduce Sparkman as a heavyweight industry speaker that uses
            visual aids. He begins by hitting the topic hard with simplistic
            magic illustrations. As the program progresses, the magic gets
            stronger and the speech gets weaker. The Best Moment is when the
            attendees drop their pens and realize they were fooled by more than
            the magic tricks.

          Everyone can benefit from a good dose of creativity. Sparkman’s
          transition from Businessman to Entertainer forced him to develop his
          creative side.<br /><br />
          He has developed “Climbing Out of the Box” to teach others ways to
          develop their creative abilities and to use that creativity in the
          business world.<br /><br />
          The ideas in this speech apply to all vocations so it is perfect for
          Chambers of Commerce and Association Conferences. Sparkman also
          tailor’s the program for specific vocations.<br /><br />
          <strong>FUN MEMORIES</strong> - The important points are illustrated
          with mental stunts and mind reading. This is fun and amazing, but more
          importantly, it is a great way to help the audience remember the
          material.

            This quote comes from the many attributed to the great Shinichi

            discoveries about teaching music to children can teach us a great
            deal about our abilities. Suzuki’s work offers proof that a healthy
            person can accomplish virtually anything. Don’t you think your
