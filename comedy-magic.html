            Food and Music are integral parts of a business party. However,
            since they are part of our everyday experience, they are rarely
            memorable. Add a good variety entertainer and suddenly you have an
            event that your employees and clients will remember for years.

            Sparkman is a memorable entertainer! He is entertaining everywhere,
            from the largest theater stages to your boardroom. The unique part
            of his programs is he performs magic with everyday objects and his
            assistants come from the audience.
          </p>
          <p class="video-card-text">
            Sparkman also uses his sleight-of-hand skills to perform magic from
            group to group at mingling events like cocktail parties and in
            hospitality suites.

              When planning this past year’s Christmas party, we wanted
              entertainment that was different from anything we’d done before.
              We toyed with using a magician, but were still somewhat leery. I
              think everyone pictured the guy pulling a bunny out of a hat - oh
              what fun. But when we viewed your video, we knew we had the right
              thing. It was really difficult to find a “clean” act, but you fit
              the bill perfectly. Not only did we enjoy your show, we were able
              to laugh at ourselves by becoming part of the act. Thanks to you,
              our Christmas party was a hit.

            Watching Sparkman’s Stage Show is a little bit like watching
            Inspector Clouseau if he were a magician. The Magic works, Sparkman
            just doesn’t seem to know when or how it works.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach makes Sparkman’s show unique and memorable. The show
            is a wild ride which is not just a series of tricks. Like a movie,
            it has an opening, middle and an ending which ties the whole show
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            The show is very funny, but it also contains strong magic. Sparkman
            does not put girls in boxes that you cannot examine. He uses
            everyday objects, that are held by his assistants from the audience.
            The minor miracles that Sparkman does with rope, coathangars, and a
            gumball machine will amaze you!
          </p>
          <p>
            The interaction with audience members provides unpredictable fun in
            the show. The emotions run from laughter, to amazement, to worry,
            and you never know how they will react. Two women actually fought
            over a magic prop at one performance. Often a stage assistant comes
            up with a funny joke that makes the whole crowd laugh. Sparkman does
            not like it when you are funnier than he, so don’t be surprised if
            he steals your line, and your watch.

          Awards Banquets are a great way to recognize employees for their

        </p>
        <p class="wakeitup-text">
          This strategy keeps the evening moving. Entertainment interspersed
          throughout the program retains the importance of the evening, whicle
          erasing the boredom. It also rewards your employees with an
          entertaining and memorable evening.

      <div class="close-up-body-wrapper">
        <p class="close-up-body-text">
          When performed by a sleight-of-hand artist, Close-Up magic is the most
          unbelievable form of magic. When Sparkman performs this style of
          magic, the spectators examine the props and the trick often happens in
          their hands.
          <br /><br />
          Your guests will also feel like they have been entertained by a friend
          as Sparkman learns their names and jokes with them. His comedic
          character, also hides the sleight-of-hand skills, which further
          disguises the method and takes the sting out of “being fooled.”
          <br /><br />
          Close-Up is also flexible. It can be performed strolling among your
          guests at cocktail parties, hospitality suites, picnics and any other
          fluid environment. It can also be performed as a formal magic show for
          small to medium sized groups, and can be combined with larger
          programs.
          <br /><br />
          Your guests can experiences coins appearing and disappearing, signed
          playing cards flying to wallets, pockets, Sparkman’s Mouth, his
          Forehead, and the ceiling. Spots will change on dice, Dollar Bills
          change to Hundred Dollar Bills, even rubber bands, dental floss and
          other average items get in on the act, while your guests participate
          and laugh.

            Sparkman mingles among the crowd performing close-up magic from
            group to group. In addition to good entertainment, it is also a
            great conversation starter. Also, if Sparkman is performing an after

            pick the good personalities to help with the show.

            Close-Up Magic is a fantastic way to entertain your customers and
            prospects in a fluid, come and go environment. Sparkman can stroll
            among them, or set up a close-up table for your guests to stop by
            and enjoy a longer set.

            This can be a long program for entertaining a group of 10 - 100
            people (special seating required for groups over 30 to insure
            visibility). Also, a full Close-Up Show is great for party
            environments. Sparkman performs shows in a separate room several
            times during the evening. Your guests take turns attending the show
            and see a complete act that is not possible when strolling.

            While Trade Show programs can take several forms, Sparkman usually
            uses magic to draw prospects to your booth. He begins by stopping
            attendees with a close-up trick. He uses additional close-up effects
            to get more people involved, and draw a larger crowd. Once he has a
            crowd, he shifts to a short program using magic to illustrate your
            products and services. Then he gets the prospects to the
            salespeople.
